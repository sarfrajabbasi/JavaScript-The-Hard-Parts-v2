//  how was this possible?

// Functions in javascript = first class objects.

// They  can co-Exist with and  can be terated like any other javascript object.

// 1 Assigned to variables and properties of other objects.

// 2 passed as arguments into functions.

// 3 Returned as values from functions.


// WHICH IS OUR HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION ?

// Ans:-The outer function that takes in a functionis our higher order function.

// WHICH IS OUR CALLBACK FUNCTION ?

// Ans:-- The function we insert is our callback function.




// ----:Higher-Order-functions:---

// Takes in a function or passes(return) out a function.

// Just a term to describe these functions-any function that does it we call that-but there's nothing different about them inherently.




// -------:Callbacks and Higher Order Functions simply our code and keep it DRY:----

// Declarative readable code :-- Map,filter,reduce-the most readble way to write code to work with data.

// Codesmith & pro interview prep:-- One of the most popular topics to test in interview both for codesmith and mid/senior level job inertview.

// Asynchronous Javascript :-- Callback are a core aspect of async javascript, and are under-the-hood of promises,async/await.

// instead i declare i wanna filter or map this data by this condition.thats make more readble code.

// it's a core part of function programming and more generally declarative programming(maping,filter etc).
// and the notion of passing in a function to the running of another function in a very different way is gonna turn out to be the backbone of asynchronous javaScript. even we are using promises,even if we're using async await behind the scenes passing in a function to another function is gonna be core to those concepts.
